In touchdown, players race to points in a rectangular "playing field." To start a game, a player chooses two corner points, a start date / time, and an end date / time. The touchdown application chooses the random points and keeps track of the game.

Once the game is initialized, players set out to the points and obtain proof that they reached the points by taking photos and / or a GPS track. Players claim their "touchdowns" using the touchdown application and upload evidence. The value of each point decreases in proportion to the number of point who scored it as a touchdown.

Touchdown does not condone trespassing.
