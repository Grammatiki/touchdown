#The relationship between touchdown and Facebook.

= When we get around to it =

I initially thought of this project as a Facebook application. After some consideration I realized Facebook integration would be nice but is not at all essential. So I think it makes sense to get touchdown in a good usable state, and then add Facebook features later on. - ~~~~

Some elements and benefits of facebook integration would be:
  * touchdowns reported as newsfeed items
  * games advertised as events
  * friends could invite friends to touchdown app
